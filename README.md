# Object-Recognition
This is a deep learning project that demonstrates how to use ResNet50 to perform object recognition on images.
ResNet50 is a convolutional neural network architecture that has been trained on a
large dataset of images, and is capable of identifying objects in images with high accuracy.

object Recognition using ResNet50 with Transfer Learning. Here we used the pre-trained model called ResNet50 for Object Recognition. Transfer Learning is an important concept in Deep Learning. 
# Getting Started


To run this project, you will need to have 
Python 3.6 or higher installed, as well as several Python libraries, including
TensorFlow, 
Keras, 
and OpenCV. 
You can install these libraries using pip, by running the following command:
